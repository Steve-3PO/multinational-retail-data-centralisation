[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## Overview 
> - This project looks to implement good practise of data extraction, cleaning and querying to subsequently assist in making business decisions for an example real world environment.
> - The goal will be to produce a system that extracts and stores the current company data in a database so that it's accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data. This is followed by querying the database to get up-to-date metrics for the business.

## Learning Objectives
> - To implement data extraction from a range of endpoints utilising AWS RDS databases, PDF conversions, API extractions and S3 buckets containg CSV files.
> - To clean the date from each source using pandas and postgresql, and set up primary-foreign key relations between tables.
> - To query the created database and draw out answers to real world questions.

## Project Structure

### Milestone 1 - "Extract and clean the data from the data sources."
> - Extract and clean the data from each source
> - Transfer the data over to a postgresql environment (pgAdmin 4)

### Milestone 2 - "Create the database schema."
> - Ensure proper typing of all tables and key constraints between them
> - Removing data that is not useful in drawing business conclusions

### Milestone 3 - "Querying the data"
> - Query the data to answer questions that provide insight into the business' practises and returns
> - Draw implementable conclusions
